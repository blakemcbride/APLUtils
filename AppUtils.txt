Application runtime utilities
-----------------------------

As stated in Utils.txt:


Typically an application would start with a function named 'start',
and ⎕LX←'Auto'.  When an application is loaded, Auto gets run in order
to initialize certain things, and then the application specific entry
point 'start' is called.  Following this procedure is necessary in
order for the Application runtime utilities to function.  This is
because they assume certain initialization had taken place before they
are called.

Calling Auto without a start function causes the application to stop
with a SI.  At this point the Application runtime functions may be
used since Auto already initialized everything.  The Generic utilities
and Development utilities do not have this requirement and may be used
at any point.


User I/O utilities (a subset of Application runtime utilities)
------------------

z←EHN v 

End, Help, or Nothing.  This function takes a string vector and returns
a three element numeric vector based on the string contents as follows:


1 0 0 = the string has 'end'
0 1 0 = the string has 'help'
0 0 1 = the string is empty
0 0 0 = the string has something else

This function is used in conjunction with the other input functions 
(Pic, Pis, Pin, etc.) in order to cause the system to branch to a 
specific location in response to pre-defined user inputs.  For example:

end     the signifies to exit a question and cause the program to go back to the
        previous question

help    this causes the system to branch to a help display message (and would normally
        return to the question)
	
(nothing)  this generally signifies to move forward without providing a response

This function is used a lot.  Typical usage:

EN4:...
...
EN5:→(EHN name←1 20 Pis 'Enter your name')/EN4, HP5, EN6
EN6:...
...
→0
HP5:'My help text'
→EN5

z←s Pic p                                                                              
 ⍝ Input single character
 ⍝ s = character vector of acceptible characters
 ⍝ p = prompt
 ⍝ z = binary vector = end, help, nothing, s[1], s[2], etc.
 
 Example usage:
 
 EN4:...
 ...
 EN5:→('yn' Pic 'Do you wish to continue')/EN4,HP5,EN4,EN6,EN4
 EN6:...
