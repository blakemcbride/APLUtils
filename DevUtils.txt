These functions generally start with WSU∆

WSU∆DisplayFns f

Display functions to the screen.  f is a comma seperated list of
function names to display.

---

z←WSU∆FindCalls f

Find all the functions a given function calls.  f is the string name
of a function.  A list of functions the function named in f calls is
returned as a character matrix.

---

WSU∆PrintFunction f

This prints a function definition to the printer.  f is the string
name of the function to print.

---

WSU∆PrintWS flg

This function prints an entire workspace to the default printer.  flg values
are as follows:

0 = print all functions
1 = print all functions except those that start with ∆
2 = print all functions except those that start with a capitol letter
3 = print all functions except those that start with ∆ or a capitol letter

Basically, you'd use 0 to print everything and 3 to excluse the utilities.

f WSU∆ReplaceFun s

This function performs a search and replace operation on a single APL
function.  f is the string name of the function to be operated on.  s
is the search and replace string that uses a helper function named
∆RD.  For example:

'myFun'  WSU∆ReplaceFun 'fromStr' ∆RD 'toStr'

---
